    <p>
      A quick learner and a creative problem solver, I am a goal-oriented, driven computer programmer with a strong work ethic. My diverse background in biological
      sciences and math pushes me to keep learning until 
      mastery of a particular skill set is achieved. The full-stack web development program at the George Washington University, School of Professional Studies has only fueled my burning desire to excel in web development and become proficient in both frontend and backend technologies.

      My detail-oriented nature along with acquired critical thinking skills enables me to go beyond what meets the eye in evaluating possible solutions to problems that emerge during individual &/or team projects. Known for pushing myself to the limit, I am relentless until the job is done--and done to my meticulous standards. Although I tend to keep a low profile, I make a great collaborator and do lead teammates by example while enjoying helping others the best way I can.
  </p>

  <p>
      My excitement is through the roof to put my inherent and acquired skills into action, showcase my individual prowess, and deliver collaborative masterpieces.

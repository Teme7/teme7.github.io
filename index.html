    <p>
      A quick learner and a creative problem solver, I am a goal-oriented, driven computer programmer with a strong work ethic. My diverse background in biological
      sciences and math pushes me to keep learning until 
      mastery of a particular skill set is achieved. Taking the full-stack web development program at the George Washington University has only fueled my burning desire to excel in web development and become proficient in both frontend and backend technologies.
  </p>

  <p> 
      My detail-oriented nature along with acquired critical thinking skills enables me to go beyond what meets the eye in evaluating possible solutions to problems that emerge during individual &/or team projects. Known for pushing myself to the limit, I am relentless until the job is done--and done to my meticulous standards. Although I tend to keep a low profile, I make a great collaborator and do lead teammates by example while enjoying helping others the best way I can.
  </p>
</br>
  <p>
      My excitement is through the roof to put my inherent and acquired skills into action, showcase my individual prowess, and deliver collaborative masterpieces.
